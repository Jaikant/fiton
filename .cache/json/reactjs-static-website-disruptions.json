The current set of start ups are templating technology with micro services!"},"createdAt":"2018-01-01T05:24:43.339Z","blog":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>In the current age of virality, there is a lot of noise, but disruptions happen silently and it may be happening while we speak.</p>\n<p>I think AI, VR, AR, IOT are enablers. (I intentionally left out blockchain as I feel it is still in early days)</p>\n<p>I believe there are a few silent trends which could be big while being beneficial to the masses. </p>\n<p>I give below a mix of human needs and some upcoming tech capabilites nicely mixed up. So you could join the dots yourself :)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Personalisation</strong>: In the age of technology and bots. There is an even greater need for personalisation. There is also a basic human nature to want to stand out from the rest. Services like facebook do not help in this as all are created equal. <strong>Now think of templates. What if everthing technology was a template.</strong> </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Templating the web</strong> : Wordpress made popular the concept of themes. Now we have technologies which is destructuring the web, so it can be more easily constructed. For example, ReactJs. ReactJs is a library which allows developers to create reusable templates for websites and apps. Using this library, it is possible to <strong>build websites from data.</strong> (This particular website is built using GatsbyJs, a static website generator built in react.). __Now think microservices.\n__</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Microservices or Serverless:</strong> <strong>This is a template too.</strong> Not tied by the browser or anything. A template of your business(logic). Computing has become very cheap, thanks to serverless technologies like AWS Lambda. This will reduce costs tremendously and in many cases will make services free. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>AI</strong>: But AI needs data. How to get data? Think microservices. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Everything is online</strong>: It is an online world now. <em>But it is aggregated.</em> They cannot stand out. Think templates for personalisation.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now think, if it was possible for anyone to create a personal website or mobile app <strong>for free</strong> on the click of a button. Like we create facebook profiles. Then why won’t they? </p>\n<p>If after doing so, they could post pictures on their website or app and select which ones go to facebook, twitter and which ones are private. And it all happens seamlessly. Will they do it? Will people start navigating off facebook into the personal spaces of their friends to learn more?</p>\n<p>Will this then, reduce facebook to a simple discovery platform. This will be ironical, because many of these trends, including technologies like reactjs and graphQL have been created by facebook.</p>\n<p>This is all possible right now. I mean the technology to create websites and apps on a click. Just think about it, this website is built from a gatsby template, from data lying in <strong>contentful</strong>. It is built, auto deployed and hosted for free using <strong>netlify</strong>. These are examples of micro services and templates. </p>\n<p>Now think Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).</p>\n<p>Maybe … or all of this could just be a thinking fallacy.</p>\n<p>Maybe the world is simply a template with intelligence running inside it. Think DNA.</p>\n<p>PS: If you are planning a start up to do the above. You could hire me to be the CTO :)</p>","timeToRead":2}},"featuredImage":{"title":"Technology for the masses.","resize":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/ojam5vx77jn8/5OLlZUyLwAywMSWSQKOgYS/27d531d9338d6705b5673865c7cbebbc/crowd.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fl=progressive&q=50&fit=fill&f=faces"},"sizes":{"aspectRatio":1.6641994546162835,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/ojam5vx77jn8/5OLlZUyLwAywMSWSQKOgYS/27d531d9338d6705b5673865c7cbebbc/crowd.jpg?w=800&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/ojam5vx77jn8/5OLlZUyLwAywMSWSQKOgYS/27d531d9338d6705b5673865c7cbebbc/crowd.jpg?w=200&h=120&q=50 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/ojam5vx77jn8/5OLlZUyLwAywMSWSQKOgYS/27d531d9338d6705b5673865c7cbebbc/crowd.jpg?w=400&h=240&q=50 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/ojam5vx77jn8/5OLlZUyLwAywMSWSQKOgYS/27d531d9338d6705b5673865c7cbebbc/crowd.jpg?w=800&h=481&q=50 800w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/ojam5vx77jn8/5OLlZUyLwAywMSWSQKOgYS/27d531d9338d6705b5673865c7cbebbc/crowd.jpg?w=1200&h=721&q=50 1200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/ojam5vx77jn8/5OLlZUyLwAywMSWSQKOgYS/27d531d9338d6705b5673865c7cbebbc/crowd.jpg?w=1600&h=961&q=50 1600w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/ojam5vx77jn8/5OLlZUyLwAywMSWSQKOgYS/27d531d9338d6705b5673865c7cbebbc/crowd.jpg?w=2400&h=1442&q=50 2400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/ojam5vx77jn8/5OLlZUyLwAywMSWSQKOgYS/27d531d9338d6705b5673865c7cbebbc/crowd.jpg?w=4272&h=2567&q=50 4272w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}},"author":{"name":"Jai","authorBio":"Jai is passionate about social issues and causes.
